# Explore-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning

In this task, we will try to understand unsupervised machine learning through clustering i.e., by segrating groups with similar traits and assign them into clusters on iris dataset. Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. We explore it using simple iris dataset.
